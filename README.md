# Rebuilding CrispTools in React

Originally [CrispTools.dev](https://crisptools.dev/) was built in Vue as a way to more deeply learn how that framework functions, and as a way to develop my own set of best practices. I'd heard a lot of positive things about Tailwind CSS and it was a great way to learn that, too.

In the end, I found that I did not like Tailwind, and that it got in my way and made the templates look like a disaster. For months, I've been meaning to find a reason to rip them out and rebuild it with simpler, cleaner templates. Because of how deeply integrated Tailwind is, this largely meant rebuilding the templates from the ground up, which is a headache.

Lately, I've been looking at migrating my knowledge over to React, which is where most of the market for front-end work seems to be. Rebuilding CrispTools seems like a good opportunity to learn the ins and outs of how to build a complex front-end in React, while also building templates from scratch.
